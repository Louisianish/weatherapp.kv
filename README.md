# WeatherApp.KV

Bonjou, toukèkènn!

Weather app originally created by CodeExplained (https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Weather-App-JavaScript) using the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to which I have added translations of weather descriptions in Kouri-Vini (Louisiana Creole). Please let me know if any of my translations aren't showing up correctly. Byin mèsi. :)

The lines I've added begin on line 75 in the section entitled "Kouri-Vini translations."

<b>To do list for Phase 1:</b> <br>
✅ Translate all weather descriptions into Louisiana Creole <br>
✅ Make it start out with Fahrenheit upon loading <br>
✅ Add note under temperature that says "click to change units" <br>
✅ Add form for option to input a city <br>
☑️ Add state and country search to API link <br>
☑️ Add more CSS <br>

<b>To do list for Phase 2:</b> <br>
☑️ <br>
☑️ Add more CSS <br>

I realize there may be an easier way to accomplish this, but the 'replace()' method and 'if else' were the best I could do with my limited knowledge. I tried doing it with key/value pairs, but I couldn't quite figure out how to get it to do what I wanted. Suggestions are always more than welcome! I'm eager to learn and improve!

# Original README by CodeExplained:

Hi Everyone!

Today we're going to create a new web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).

In this tutorial, a JavaScript Beginner can create a functional Weather App with ease. and won't face any problems doing that.

You must know the basics in JavaScript and HTML, like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc

The only difficulty you might face, is how to work with an API using JavaScript? but trust me that won't be of a big problem.

Let's talk about the application you're going to build; our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (London, GB).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The icons we're going to use for our web application are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager.
Link to her Repo: https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org

To Create this web application please follow the tutorial on my channel:https://youtu.be/KqZGuzrY9D4
