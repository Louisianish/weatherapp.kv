# WeatherApp.KV
 Weather app originally created by CodeExplained (https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Weather-App-JavaScript) to which I've begun adding translations of weather descriptions in Kouri-Vini (Louisiana Creole). Please let me know if any of my translations aren't showing up correctly. Byin m√®si. :)

The lines I've added begin on line 75 in the section entitled "Kouri-Vini translations."

I realize there may be an easier way to accomplish this, but the 'replace()' function was the best I could do with my limited knowledge. I tried doing it with key/value pairs, but I couldn't quite figure out how to get it to do what I wanted. Suggestions are always more than welcome! I'm eager to learn and improve!
